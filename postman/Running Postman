As our designed response type is JSON, the tests look differently to those in Ares.

The tests in this collection check for:
 - Response status, 200 is running correctly
 - Whether response is valid JSON
 - Whether question data is valid JSON
 - Response contains 5 questions (as in prompt, can be changed, marked by comment)
 - Each question has an answer



To run the tests:

API: PMAK-67dc032a1d5a8c000110d126-4d5f213eb223dd0279b2b06fa33235f478

To run the tests through terminal node.js and newman is needed:
npm install -g newman

Command to run collection:
newman run postman/collection.json

You can test your prompts by changing values in:

"body": {
          "mode": "raw",
          "raw": "{\"grammar_construct\": \"present simple\", \"num_ques\": 5, \"cefr_lvl\": \"A2\", \"num_negative\": 2, \"num_neutral\": 2, \"num_interrogative\": 1}"
